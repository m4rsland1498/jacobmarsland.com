            <h3>About the Subject</h3>
            <p>
                "Our A Level Computer Science qualification helps students understand the core academic principles of
                computer science. Classroom learning is transferred
                into creating real-world systems through the creation of an
                independent programming project. Our A Level will develop the
                studentâ€™s technical understanding and their ability to analyse
                and solve problems using computational thinking." - <a href="https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/as-and-a-level/computer-science-h046-h446-from-2015/">ocr.org.uk</a>

            <h3>Why I Took This Subject</h3>
            <p>
                I took Computer Science A-level to consolidate
                my knowledge and understanding of computers, 
                learn more, and become more competent in coding. 
                I am looking at a future in a digital world and 
                I want to be able to contribute my part to that 
                because I have a strong interest and passion in 
                computing of all sorts.
            </p>

            <h3>Predicted Grades</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently predicted a grade A.

            <h3>Non-Exam Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                For my NEA, I am developing a "Micromouse Simulator". Micromouse
                is a robotics competition where people and teams race small,
                autonomous robots (called "micromice"), through a maze that has
                not been seen before. My simulator aims to capture and represent all the
                elements of a micromouse race from the rules to the pathfinding to the 
                physics whilst keeping an intuitive and useful user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to make this for my NEA as it is something I find very
                interesting, includes lots of different elements for me to code such
                as UI, physics, and maze-solving/generation, and because I want to
                challenge myself to make something both tricky and unique.
