            <h3>Why I Took This Subject</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to take up Further Maths to "further" my maths knowledge. 
                It's in the name! I truly enjoy maths and want to be able to aim higher 
                in the subject. It also helps with the algorithmic and computational thinking 
                that is needed for a true understanding of Computer Science and Software Development.
            </p>

            <h3>Predicted Grades</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently predicted a grade A.
