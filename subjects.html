        <h2>Sixth Form</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying at Tadcaster Grammar School, where I have developed a passion for learning and have had the opportunity to study a wide variety of subjects. The supportive learning environment, dedicated teachers, and resources have helped me build a strong foundation in both academic and personal skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            At TGS, I have been able to explore subjects that align with my interests, especially in Computer Science, which have inspired me to pursue a career in Software Development and Cyber Security.

        <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
        <p>
            2 of my friends and I set up a CTF club - Capture The Flag.
            This is held once a week, at lunch for Year 10s to 13s.
            We use different websites that host CTF challenges such as PicoCTF.
            This introduces and familiarises students with the skills and know-how
            of file manipulation, web exploitation, cryptography, and many more skills
            involved in ethical hacking and cyber-security.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            During the w/c the 1st of July 2024, I spent a week at a company called
            <a href="https://www.appsanywhere.com/">AppsAnywhere</a> for work experience. AppsAnywhere is a company who creates
            a cloud-based app delivery system for schools, colleges, and universities
            across the world to allow students easy access to a variety of applications.
        </p>
        <p></p>
            Throughout the week, I spent my time in different parts of the company and
            with different people to see how they work and develop software in a 
            work environment. It was very interesting to see how the company and their
            software worked. I learnt a lot from the business side of development to 
            some of the workings of how PHP can be used to create an efficient and effective
            backend.
