        <h2>Sixth Form</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying at Tadcaster Grammar School, where I have developed a passion for learning and have had the opportunity to study a wide variety of subjects. The supportive learning environment, dedicated teachers, and resources have helped me build a strong foundation in both academic and personal skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            At TGS, I have been able to explore subjects that align with my interests, especially in [mention relevant subjects], which have inspired me to pursue a career in [mention future career aspirations if relevant]. The school has also offered me various extracurricular activities, helping me grow as a well-rounded individual.

        <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
        <p>
            2 of my friends and I set up a CTF club - Capture The Flag.
            This is held once a week, at lunch for Year 10s to 13s.
            We use different websites that host CTF challenges such as PicoCTF.
            This introduces and familiarises students with the skills and know-how
            of file manipulation, web exploitation, cryptography, and many more skills
            involved in ethical hacking and cyber-security.
