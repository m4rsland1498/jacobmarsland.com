                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>I have been learning and developing using Python
                    for 4 years now. I utilise and understand a variety
                    of Python packages that can be used in many situations
                    for a wide range of projects.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>I began to learn HTML about a year 
                    ago now and have become proficient in creating
                    structured web pages.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Along with learning HTML, I also learnt CSS to be
                    able to style my websites. As a side note,
                    I have also utilised and learnt small elements of
                    Javascript but I do not know enough just yet to be able to justify
                    it as its own skill.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Databases</h3>
                <p>
                    I have used PHP and SQL in conjunction with one 
                    another and HTML to create a sign in/sign up system
                    for a website to better understand how to use databases.
                    Fun fact: that's what jacobmarsland.com used to be!
